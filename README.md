# SortMyFiles
Just a way to organize files


This is my first project on github. I will be very glad to receive advice.

1) You must specify the directory where the sorting will take place (Ex. E:\MyFiles)
2) Then folders are created with the name corresponding to the extensions of the files located in the directory
3) Files are sorted according to the extension
